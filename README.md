Here, I present you, my personal To-Do List project, which, will help, you to keep in mind simple, yet important things to remember.

## Context of my project

I did this project, as part of the programming course, named *YouCode*, and I treat it, as incredible way to practice *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JS*!

## Optional user interactions
- You can hide/show finished tasks, by clicking button named *"Ukryj ukończone"* (eng. *"Hide doned"*). You are able to display back hidden tasks, by clicking the button again.
- You can quickly finish all tasks on the list, by clicking button named *"Ukończ wszystkie"* (eng. *"finish all"*). After click, the button will become disable to interact, unless you add new unfinished task.

## Tasks statistics

You can track informations, about your tasks list, thanks to the Stats Section. This section allows you to:
- check total tasks list length in green paragraph
- check amount of doned tasks in purple paragraph

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
